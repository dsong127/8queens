# 8 Queens - Genetic Algorithm Solution

Solving the 8 queens puzzle using genetic algorithm. The goal of the program is to place 8 queens on a board in such a way that no queens are attacking each other.  
Change global variables N and mutation_pct to experiment with different population number and mutation percentage.
